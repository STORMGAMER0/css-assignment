    <p>Hello Sir!</p>
    <p>I dont think you're gonna see this, but if you do, i just wanted to tell you this course(so far) has been a very nice rollercoaster of fun and learning. you're an <span>AMAZING</span> Instructor for real. I was quite terrified prior to the start of this course because i didnt have faith that i could learn any of these. but thanks to you, your teaching methods and your well curated notes, i was able to create these designs. i still cant believe i manged to pull assignment 6 off eventually(though barely) </p>
    <p>besides assignment 4, i didnt do a very good job at responsiveness. i havent quite gotten the hang of how to place a responsive width. i'll contiue to practice css despite being in the backend track!</p>
    <p>Thank you once again Mr Setemi! much love and appreciation</p>
